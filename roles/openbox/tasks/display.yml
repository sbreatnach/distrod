# TODO: create a program that:
# 1) Parses currently configured xrandr output and saves as profile (autorandr does this)
# 2) Can detect which profiles are available currently (autorandr does this)
# 3) Can load profile on request (autorandr does this)
# 2) Allows user to specify order of priority of profiles for user
# 3) Loads the first matched profile in the priority list for the current user.
# 4) Can run as daemon that detects events from the X server (similar to https://bitbucket.org/portix/srandrd)
# 5) On new/removed display events, load the first matched profile
